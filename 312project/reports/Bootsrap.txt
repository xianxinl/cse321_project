BootstrapWe have used Bootstrap for our front-end design. Bootstrap mainly solved issues including gridding, layout, button, navigation, and other interface components. Bootstrap is very powerful and we save a lot of time in front-end development. We have use Bootstrap throughout our front-end development, for example we have used Bootstrap css stylesheet such as bootstrap-grid.min.css, bootstrap-select.css, menu_sideslide.css, in our homepage development. We have used bootstrap-grid.min.css to develop our layout and general gridding for the homepage. And we have use boostrap-select.css to choose the selective style for certain interface. And menu_sideslide.css is used for navigation menu, which the menu would be use for feature such as friend and chat. Those are the three current Bootstrap css stylesheet we have use for our front-end development. Bootstrap is a free of charge, and open-source framework for web development.
