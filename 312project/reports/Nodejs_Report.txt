Node.js What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?Node.js is designed as a runtime environment, our project is able to create persistent connection between client and server and achieve real time elements updates on multiple frontend pages. In backend, we use node.js as a web server which create an HTTP server that keep listening to” localhost 8080”How does this technology accomplish what it does? It uses non-blocking, event-driven I/O which provides effective execution time Comparing to tradition server script, node.js is asynchronous which handles multiple requests within a single process. Simplify speaking, it works like putting multiple requests into a queue, and execute the ready request on the top of queue. Using the exist “http” module, due to its non-blocking I/O request design, the server is able to handle multiple requests from two clients simultaneously.License:Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which is free of charge, without limitation the right to use, copy , modify , merge , publish …. , details license information is provided in https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/LICENSE
